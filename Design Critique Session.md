# Tips

When preparing to present ask

- who are you designing for
- what problem are you solving
- how are the designs solving and not solving that problem
- where in the design process are you
- what aspects of the design are you seeking feedback on

When presenting

- ask clarifying questions to understand the reviewer's point of view
- take notes
