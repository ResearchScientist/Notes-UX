# Process

- write the desired solution as a [Goal Statement](#Goal%20Statement)
- draw a [Storyboard](Tooling/Storyboard.md)
- design the [Information Architecture](#Information%20Architecture)
- construct [Wireframes](Tooling/Wireframes.md)

# Goal Statement

The goal statement describes the solution to the problem defined in the [Problem Statement](Design%20Thinking/2-Define.md#Problem%20Statement).

The goal statement

- identifies the user
- describes what the product will do
- explains why the product solves the user's need

**Example**

> Help users go to the gym to become stronger so they can eat heavier cakes.


# Information Architecture

Diagrams include

- site map

**Benefits**

- illustrates the overall structure of the product
- helps determine what information should be included or excluded
- informs how to organize data
- easy to iterate


# Tree Tests

n = 50 gives 90% Confidence Level with 10% margin of error
