Prototypes are used to

- visualize an idea
- assess feasibility
- test design effectiveness

# Process

- write the desired solution as a [Goal Statement](#Goal%20Statement)
- draw a [Storyboard](Tooling/Storyboard.md)
- design the [Information Architecture](#Information%20Architecture)
- construct [Wireframes](Tooling/Wireframes.md)
- build [Interactivity](#Interactivity)

# Goal Statement

The goal statement describes the solution to the problem defined in the [Problem Statement](Design%20Thinking/2-Define.md#Problem%20Statement).

The goal statement

- identifies the user
- describes what the product will do
- explains why the product solves the user's need

**Example**

> Help users go to the gym to become stronger so they can eat heavier cakes.


# Information Architecture

Illustrates the organizational relationships between a product's components.

Diagrams include

- site map

**Benefits**

- illustrates the overall structure of the product
- helps determine what information should be included or excluded
- informs how to organize data
- easy to iterate

# Interactivity

Build out the interactive elements of the prototype. You can use paper or digital mockups.

Goal is to identify how users interact with the prototype.

## Paper

**Benefits**

- quick iterations
- collaborative
- best in a focus group setting

**Process**

- make cut outs for the various elements
- make a cut out of the screen
- layout order of interaction
- have user touch elements and have a team mate move the elements as a response

## Digital

**Benefits**

- quick iterations
- can be tested by remote users
- interactions can be recorded by software

**Process**

- within software connect digital wireframes
- choose transitions
- present to user for testing
