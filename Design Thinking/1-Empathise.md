# Goal

Goal is to understand the user's needs, goals, and pain points.

# Discover

Make a central hub for documenting your learnings about your users. 

**Map**

- gather data from observational interviews

Illustrate your findings with an [Empathy Map](Tooling/Empathy%20Map.md).

**Persona**

- gather data from user interviews
- identify the main user group
- detail their goals and frustrations

Draw a [Persona](Tooling/Persona.md) to represent the main user group.

You will need multiple personas to capture various key user groups.

# Inform

Use a [User Story](Tooling/User%20Story.md) to communicate a user's goal and motivation.

Use a [Journey Map](Tooling/Journey%20Map.md) to illustrate a user's pain points and emotional state as they progress towards their goal.
