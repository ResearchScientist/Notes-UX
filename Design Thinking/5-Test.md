## Conduct

The goal of a usability study is to

- identify user pain points
- discover opportunities for improvement
- learn about the user

Concept Testing : early stage product usability study

### Moderated

Moderator guides participants through the study in real time.

**Pros**

- moderator can dynamically ask clarifying questions
- rapport can be built

**Cons**

- moderator can introduce bias
- participant may not relate to moderator

**Process**

- greet, thank, and build rapport with participant
- inform of the process and their options
- if they cannot complete a task it is not their fault, it indicates a flaw in the design
- instruct user to think aloud while they interact with the app and read the prompts

**Questions**

- ask open ended questions
- ask follow up questions
- summarize their response

### Unmoderated

Participants test a prototype without any guidance.

Interaction is usually recorded, and footage reviewed at a later time.

**Pros**

- product can be used within real context
- participant may give more candid feedback

**Cons**

- issues cannot be addressed in real time
- cannot ask clarifying questions in real time

**Process**

Set up automation to instruct, present prompts, and record interaction.

- present prompt 
- present digital prototype
- record interaction

### Notes

Take notes when conducting a usability study regardless of it being recorded or not.
You are taking notes about your own thoughts and observations during the study.

- user's body language
- facial expressions
- tone of voice
- capture user quotes

You can take notes on a sheet of paper, sticky notes, or digitally.

**Table**

|Observation|User 1|User 2|User 3|
|--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|clics on help button|x|||
|chooses dark theme||x|x|
|tone positive|x|x||
|tone negative|||x|
|confused|x|||

Observations in a table can be colour coded or organized by topic if you are prefilling the table with anticipated user behaviours.

For example
The first 2 are user actions, the next 2 are tone of voice, the last one is emotion.

Some useful things to observe are

- user actions
- tone of voice
- emotion
- assumptions and expectations
- reactions to unexpected interactions

Best to have all team members observing the study to take notes.
Discuss and consolidate the notes after the observation is complete.

## Analyze

Analyze and synthesize the data from the study.

**Steps**

- Gather data and organize it with an [Affinity Diagram](Tooling/Affinity%20Diagram.md).
- Tally observation occurrences from the table to find patterns.
- The observations with the highest occurrence rates are themes.
- Verbalize insights that are based on the data, answer the research questions, are easy to understand, increase empathy for the user experience, and direct explicit action.

## Share

Share insights with stakeholders via

- reports
- presentations

Include

- methods
- data
- conclusions
- recommendations

### Report
