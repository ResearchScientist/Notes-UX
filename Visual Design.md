The basic [Design Elements](Visual%20Design/Design%20Elements.md) of visual design lead to [Design Principles](Visual%20Design/Design%20Principles.md). Make sure to also consider [Gestalt Principles](Visual%20Design/Gestalt%20Principles.md) in your design.

Design Review Checklist

- [ ] consistent elements such as colour, typography, size
- [ ] consistent scale and balance
- [ ] consistent layout

Build a [Design System](Tooling/Design%20System.md) for each project. This helps with consistency and speeds up iterations.
