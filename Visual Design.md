The basic [Design Elements](Visual%20Design/Design%20Elements.md) of visual design lead to [Design Principles](Visual%20Design/Design%20Principles.md). Make sure to also consider [Gestalt Principles](Visual%20Design/Gestalt%20Principles.md) in your design.

Design Review Checklist

- [ ] consistent elements such as colour, typography, size
- [ ] consistent scale and balance
- [ ] consistent layout

Build a [Design System](Tooling/Design%20System.md) for each project. This helps with consistency and speeds up iterations.

# Feedback

Accept feedback gracefully and as an opportunity for growth.

When giving a designer feedback

- describe the issue being caused
- do not criticize the design
- do not offer a design solution , allow the designer to design a solution

When getting feedback

- ask questions to understand the reviewer's point of view
- remember they want to help

Attend a [Design Critique Session](Design%20Critique%20Session.md) to provide or receive feedback on designs.
