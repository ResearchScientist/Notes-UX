# Process

- define the problem to be solved with a [Problem Statement](#Problem%20Statement)
- hypothesize solutions to the problem with a [Hypothesis Statement](#Hypothesis%20Statement)

# Problem Statement

One sentence that describes the user, their goal, and the reason for their goal.

{ user name } is a { user characteristics } who needs { user needs } because { user insight }.

**Example**

> Pusheen is a cat who needs to go to the gym because the cakes are getting heavier.

You can use a [Persona](Tooling/Persona.md) to identify the user and the user characteristics, a [User Story](Tooling/User%20Story.md) to identify what the user needs and an [Empathy Map](Tooling/Empathy%20Map.md) to identify why they need to meet that goal.

A well defined problem statement informs

- goal to focus on
- constraints to consider
- deliverables to build
- success benchmarks

# Hypothesis Statement

Best guess at a possible solution to a design problem.

If { action } then { outcome }.

**Example** Simple

> If Pusheen works out every day then he will be strong enough to eat the heavier cakes.

**Example** Robust

> Engineering weights that speak motivational messages to the user will encourage the user to continue working out because
> some user's
> - loose interest
> - have self deprecating thoughts
> - like company
> - benefit from encouragement

The robust example includes a list of assumptions. These should be validated.

# Human Factors

A few factors to consider

- changing user needs
- cognitive load
- concentration
- fears
- memory
- motivation
- patience levels
- user errors

# Psychological Effects

- Von Restorff : Given a set of similar objects, the one that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered.
- Serial Position Effect : Given a list of items, the first few and last few are more likely to be remembered.
- Hick's Law : As number of options increase, decision making time increases.
