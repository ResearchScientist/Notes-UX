A storyboard is a visualization that illustrates a portion of a [Journey Map](Tooling/Journey%20Map.md). 
Focus is on visuals. This helps makes the user and their experience memorable to stakeholders.

Write the user scenario in one sentence.

The storyboard visualizes the user's steps through that scenario.

- scenario : short description of the user's goal
- visuals : key actions and context
- captions : summarize actions, environment, emotional state

# Types

- big picture storyboards : focus on the user
	- inform on user expectations
	- inform on user emotions
- close up storyboards : focus on the product
	- inform on how to product performs
	- inform on user actions
	- inform on flow

For a big picture storyboard illustrate the user's key moments and emotions.
Best for stakeholder buyin.

For a close up storyboard illustrate the products key UI interactions and user actions.
Best for redesign.

You can combine both types but make sure to explore only one path per board.
