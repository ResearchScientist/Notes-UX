Wireframes are low fidelity prototypes.

Goal is to represent the structure and hierarchy of elements.

# Format

Comprised of

- lines
- basic shapes
- text

# Medium

Can be

- paper
- digital

# Style

Can be

- rough sketches with pencil or pen
- precisely measured drawings

# Standard Formatting

- lines : represent text
- boxes with x : represent images
- boxes : represent calls to action

# Benefits

- inform on usability
- inform on call to action placement
- inform on element hierarchy
- fast iterations

# Process

- list required information to be represented
	- such as navigation, images, text
- draw a wireframe representing that information
- draw more wireframes each varying the representation of that information
- for each wireframe document your thought process for its design decisions
- review wireframes
	- pick elements from each wireframe that stood out as most beneficial
	- mark them or highlight them
	- document why they stood out
- if paper was used, take pictures and add to documentation
- get feedback
