Affinity diagrams are used for discovering patterns and themes.

# Process

- Each observation is placed on a sticky note.
- Gather all notes and place on a table or wall.
- For each observation ask if it is similar or related to another observation.
	- if similar, group observations together
	- if different, place it as a separate group
- Once all notes have been considered, revisit the groupings and make changes if needed.
- Any notes not belonging to any groups can be set aside.
