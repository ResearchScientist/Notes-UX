# Design Sprint
Brief

## Sprint Challenge

What is the challenge that you want to solve for?

- the challenge is something real that the team can deliver
- it's stated in a way that sounds inspiring, something to solve for
- it's clear and concise
- it's time bound, next quarter

**Example**

>Build the dark theme feature that will set us apart as the coolest app by the end of this quarter.

## Key Deliverables

What do you want the team to make during the sprint?

- low fidelity is fine for testing
- for delivery make the highest fidelity feasible given the constraints
- list platforms and environments that need to be designed for

**Example**

> Prototype of toggling between light and dark theme including the transition animation.
