# Study Details

## Project Background

Why is the study needed and what impact will insights have on decisions.

**Example**

> We are producing a dumbbell that helps motivate cats to lift more weight. We want to determine if a dumbbell that counts out loud number of cakes as reps motivates cats to continue lifting.

## Details

**Research Questions**
- question 1
- question 2

**Participants**
- n
- brief demographics
- brief characteristics

**Methods**
- duration
- location
- type of study
- brief high level overview of study process

**Example**

> **Research Question**
> Do cats that use the talking dumbbell continue lifting more or less or at the same rate than cats that don't use a talking dumbbell.
> 
> **Participants**
> 10 cats. 5m 5f. 3 Calico, 4 toms, 3 mix.
> 
> **Methods**
> Unmoderated usability study. Cats documented the number of sessions they completed over 1 month. Cats where asked weekly to self report their motivation to continue lifting.

**Survey**

# Themes

- theme
- substantiate with data
- substantiate with a quote
- include screen shots if helpful

**Example**

> Most of the talking weight users reported increased motivation for lifting.
> - 4 out of 5 cats (80%) reported increased motivation (talking weight group)
> - 2 out of 5 cats (40%) reported increased motivation (non talking weight group)

> "The weight is like a personal hype coach. Hearing the cake count go up is amazing!"
> cat 3

# Insights

Insights listed by most impactful or urgent to least.

**High Priority (P0)**
Must be addressed , urgent
- main user flow cannot be completed
- existence of deceptive patterns
- experience not equitable or accessible

**Med Priority (P1)**
Addressed after P0 insights have been resolved , not urgent
- features that improve usability

**Low Priority (P2)**
Added to a backlog but not prioritized , not urgent
- nice to have features , don't necessarily improve user experience

**Example**

> P0 : cat unable to understand talking weight
> one of the cats spoke a regional dialect different than the one we recorded
> 
> P1 : one of the weights stopped talkin
> the speaker got wet from cat fluid and stopped working

# Recommendations

Recommended solutions to insights presented.

**Example**

> P0 : localize recordings
> 
> P1 : engineer a liquid proof casing for the speakers
