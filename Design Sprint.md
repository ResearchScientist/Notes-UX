# Process

A design sprint consists of 5 phases carried over 5 days.

- [Understand](##Understand)
- [Ideate](##Ideate)
- [Decide](##Decide)
- [Prototype](##Prototype)
- [Test](##Test)

## Plan

- have at least a rough or basic understanding of the problem to be solved
- schedule expert feedback
- have a large enough and quiet room with a whiteboard and comfortable chairs
- bring supplies
	- markers
	- sticky notes
	- water
	- snacks
- outline the rules
- facilitate team introductions
- facilitate an ice breaker
	- ask team to talk about a time they called customer service to complain
	- this puts the team in the mindset of the user, making it easier to come up with solutions from their perspective
- document by selecting team members to
	- take pictures of white board
	- gather stickies
	- take notes on solutions discussed
- prepare a [Sprint Brief](Tooling/Sprint%20Brief.md) to share with team

## Understand

- understand the challenge
## Ideate

- brainstorm solutions
## Decide

- converge on a solution
- schedule user tests
## Prototype

- make a working testable mvp
## Test

- observe users using the prototype
- interview users about their experience using the prototype

# After The Sprint

Once the sprint is complete, schedule a [Retrospective](Retrospective.md).
