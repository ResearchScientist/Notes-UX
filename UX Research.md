UX Research occurs throughout the product development lifecycle.

# Research Categories
## Foundational Research

Occurs prior to the design phase.
Can also be called strategic or generative.

### Goal

To define the problem.

Answer the following questions

- what are the user problems
- how can we solve them
- what should we build

### Strategies

- user interviews

## Design Research

Occurs during the design phase.
Can also be called tactical.

### Goal

To inform on the design.

Answers the following question

- how should we build it
- what are the friction points the user encounters during the prototyping
- how can we remove those friction points

### Strategies

- user interviews
	- how was your prototype experience
	- was it easy to use why
	- did you encounter any challenges

## Post Launch Research

Occurs after the design phase.

### Goal

To evaluate how well a product is meeting the user needs.

Answers the question

- did we succeed

### Strategies

- interviews

# Methods

- interviews : individually gather opinions, thoughts, experiences, feelings
- surveys : same question given to many respondents
- usability study : product evaluation by testing it on users

# Biases

Types of biases and how to overcome them.

- confirmation bias : looking for evidence to prove a held hypothesis
	- actively listen
	- ask open ended questions
	- large diverse n
	- consistent interview method
- false consensus bias : overestimation of n who agree with us
	- identify and articulate your assumptions
	- large diverse n
	- consistent interview method
- primacy bias : memory of first encounter is strongest
	- make a recording
	- take detailed notes
	- consistent interview method
- recency bias : easier to remember the last thing encountered
	- make a recording
	- take detailed notes
	- consistent interview method
- implicit bias : attitudes and stereotypes attributed to others without our awareness
	- reflect on our behaviours
	- ask others to point out our biases
- sunk cost fallacy : the more invested into a project the more difficult to change
	- break project into phases
	- outline evaluation points where you can decide to continue or stop

# Pain Points

Categories for user struggles.

- financial : such as a paywall
- product : the delivered feature itself is flawed
- process : user flow is interrupted
- service : user needs assistance but cs or onboarding is not adequate

# Edge Cases

Identify by

- making personas
- making user stories
- making wireframes
- thoroughly reviewing the product prior to launch

# Methods

Example of methods per phase.
It is not necessary to use each method. Only use what is appropriate for the project.

## Discover

Goal : Validate and discard assumptions.

- constraint inventory
- diary studies
- field studies
- observations
- user interviews
- stakeholder interviews
## Explore

Goal : Understand the problem.

- card sorting
- competitive analysis
- design reviews
- journey mapping
- persona building
- task analysis
## Test

Goal : Confirm design solves the user problem.

- accessibility evaluation
- benchmark testing
- qualitative testing
- track usability
## Listen

Goal : Understand new problems.

- analytics review
- FAQ reviews
- search log analysis
- surveys
- usability bug reviews
