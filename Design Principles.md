# Gestalt Principles

Human visual object perception.

- closure
- common region
	- items within a space are a group
- continuity
- figure
- proximity
	- close items are more related to each other than to farther items
- similarity
	- similarly coloured, shaped, or scaled items have the same function
- symmetry
- order

# Dark Patterns

- motel : easy to subscribe difficult to unsubscribe
- forced continuity : billed after trial expires without informing
- sneaking into basket : extra product auto added to purchase
- hidden charges : undisclosed fees added during checkout
- shaming : writing guilt inducing copy for a call to action
- urgency : limited time offers
- scarcity : limited products
- endless scroll : fear of missing out
